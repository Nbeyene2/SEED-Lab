Demo 2
This folder contains all of the code and documents that were created for Demo 2. 
The computer vision files are used to detect an Aruco marker and send five bytes to the Arduino over I2C:
  The first byte is a boolean value that is true if a marker is dectected, false if not detected.
  The second and third bytes are the difference angle from the marker to the middle of the camera.
  The fourth and fifth bytes are the distance from the camera to the marker.
The Arduino code uses the same motor controller code as used before, we just added a state machine that goes through the different stages of the demo.
  The robot will spin until finding a marker, then adjust to align directly on the marker, then move toward the marker until within 12 inches, then move an additional 12 inches and stop.
We also have included the demo 2 video of the robot performing each test.
