Final Demo
This folder contains all of the code and documents that were created for the Final Demo. 
The computer vision files are used to detect an Aruco marker and send five bytes to the Arduino over I2C:
  The first byte is a boolean value that is true if the correct marker is dectected, false if not detected.
  The second and third bytes are the difference angle from the marker to the middle of the camera.
  The fourth and fifth bytes are the distance from the camera to the marker.
The Arduino code uses the same motor controller code and state machine as before, we just implemented an array for the six markers that allows us to know which marker we are looking for.
  The robot will spin until finding the correct marker, then adjust to align directly on the marker, then move toward the marker until within 12 inches, then move an additional 12 inches and stop if it is the last marker or repeat if not.
